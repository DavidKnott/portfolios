# David Knott - M2 Portfolio

## End of Module Reflection

What did you get technically and professionally out of this module? How are you going to use it in the future?

  The biggest thing I learned this module technically was the importance of following conventions, particularly when using a framework like rails, in order to increase readability for others who are expecting certain parts of my program to be in specific files.  Proffessionally I realised the importance of building up my network and realised that I prefer networking events (such as meetups) followed by outreach to cold outreach because it feels more authentic.

#### Grit: Passion and Perserverance

Write 3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently.

### Professional Development Workshops

####[Feedback II]https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/feedback_ii.md

I use feedback as a way to get my bearings because in the majority of interactions I participate in I'm only getting half the story.  Usually if I say somone that offends someone or act in a way that's unbecoming other people will judge me and decide to reduce the frequency of our interactions.  This is hard for me because I can't improve if I don't know what the problem is.  That's where feedback comes into play, when someone speaks their mind about how they think I'm doing I can look at it and see if anything they're saying is true. If it is, I can work on it,
E.G:
David I noticed when your explaining things I sometimes feel losses.

I can take that piece of feedback and try to explain my ideas in a slower and more tranquil manner.

#### [Finding Opportunities](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/finding_opportunities.md)

This talk inspired the start of my "networking proccess" I started looking up jobs around the country that seemed cool and got super excited because a lot of jobs ask for the skills that I'm learning at Turing (particularly SQL).  In terms of deliverables, I created a list of 12 companies that were currently hiring junior devs.

#### [Collaborative Communication](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/collaborative_communication.md)

Up until Littleshop I had always worked in groups of two or three and we were working in the same room 80%.  We had dealt with merging to master by agreeding that it only be done when all team members were present.  My Littleshop project was a complete 180 with two members leaving Denver as soon as possible everyday in order to avoid traffic on the bus ride home to Fort Collins.  This led to my group doing 90% of our work indivually and utilizeing slack, wafflie, and github pull request reviewer.  Looking back this was an extremly good oppturunity in terms of learning how to work in a team without actually being together which I'm sure will come in handy many times in the future throughout a (hopeffully long) codding career.

I love self-improvement and theirfore I love feedback.  Simply put, the more it hurts (if it's given in a constructive manner) the truer it is and the more essential it is the I work on whatever the feedback suggests.  If it was as easy as deciding to work on feedback then I would be near perfect, but it's not. Being a better persion through incorporation feedback into ones life it a constant decision to loosen up ones grip on the pride and identity that the majoriy of us tend to cling on to for dear life and to step into the unknown.


#### [Cold Outreach](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/cold_outreach.md)

After the cold outreach talk I took my lesson to the next level.  I quickly became competent at aquiring the emails of developers in the companies that I might want to work for in the future and sending them a conscise email inviting them for coffee.  I was a little suprised when some actually tooke me up on the offer (strangers can be amazing people sometime!).

### [Networking](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/networking.md)

I felt like I had a good understanding of  networking practice because the night before I had 3 hours of constant pitching at a networking event. Over the past few days I've been able to transform my routine from a lackluster student at "just another cooding school" who only knows ruby and rails to a junior developer who realizes that although he's new to the industry the passion that lights up his face and his ability to hold decent (some would say life changing) conversations will get him far.

## D: Feedback

### Giving Feedback

To Ethan:
Ethan, I enjoyed working with you this project.  I feel like I can always count on you when I’m having trouble figuring something out and I need a little help.  I admire your determination to practice concepts that you don’t feel as comfortable with (issue 19 was no walk in the park) and your willingness to participate in networking adventures with me at only a moments notice.  I felt like we worked well together on this project in part because you are a very eloquent speaker.  Whenever you explained an issue or offered a solution it was delivered in a manner that was easy to understand and implement.  I’m pumped to code with you in the future!

To Brett:
Brett you do a wonderful job of keeping our group on track, particularly by reminding us all to use the waffle.  Your bluntness over the course of this project was refreshing because it allowed me to not waste time or mental power wondering how you were “feeling.”  I feel lucky to have gotten the chance to know you better and over the course of this project I’ve come to realize that you have a really good heart (that’s not just fluff, i actually think it). Keep up the good work and I hope to work with you again on another project.

To Jesse:
Jesse you were the calming wind of the group, you injected humor into every conversation which was vital to maintaining group moral.  In terms of your contributions to the groups workload I couldn’t help but notice that you constantly volunteered to do any issue that came up on the waffle board and were always eager to be a second set of eyes. In other words keep doing what your doing and you’ll go far. It was a pleasure and an honor to have completed little shop with you.

To Eric:
Eric, I love your inquisitive nature, wether it be while pairing or talking about more personal matters (I still remember the conversation we had before Christmas break fondly) I always leave my conversations with you feeling more grounded.  Looking back on our project I think it would’ve been helpful if you asked more questions during the project when you didn’t feel completely  comfortable with the material because although we did need to finish the project I would’ve been happy to spend time attempting to explain anything you were fuzzy on.   Overall I’m happy with how our project turned out and I would be excited if I saw our names together for a future project.

To Nick:
Nick, you inspire me.  Straight and simple I love your energy and optimism about going into the machine learning and data science industries.  Your passion leads me to reflect more about what job  would make my eyes light up with enthusiasm day after day.  In terms of our project together I felt that you were a huge asset because whenever I felt stuck you helped keep the ball rolling forward.  Lastly, our website looks amazing because of your styling which I appreciate a lot because styling is one of the things I struggle most with.  Bravo!

### Being a Community Member

From Ethan:
David: It seems like solving the logic problems behind most of this back-end stuff is really intuitive for you, so I think it’s been a huge advantage having you in our group. I’ve never seen any problem that’s made you visibly frustrated, and that’s a great asset for working on a team. I’m looking forward to working/networking more with you in the second half!

From Brett:
Brett you do a wonderful job of keeping our group on track, particularly by reminding us all to use the waffle.  Your bluntness over the course of this project was refreshing because it allowed me to not waste time or mental power wondering how you were “feeling.”  I feel lucky to have gotten the chance to know you better and over the course of this project I’ve come to realize that you have a really good heart (that’s not just fluff, i actually think it). Keep up the good work and I hope to work with you again on another project.

From Eric:
I worked on Bike-Share with David. Whenever I'm around him, I feel he's about to explode with energy. His intensity is a great asset to any team. He loves his work and it shows. He's a bottomless well of idea for how to solve an issue. A de-bugging machine, really. At moments, I felt out of the loop on his thought process and subsequently lost my bearings.

From Nick:
Working with David was a pleasure. He’s intelligent, knows his material, and is not afraid to take on challenging problems. 100% reliable. David came through multiple times with unique solutions by diving deep into ActiveRecord, which improved the overall outcome of our project immensely. Always a fun guy to be around, even while banging his head on the computer for hours trying to figure out what broke our database. Look forward to continue learning and building code with this guy.

## E: Community Participation

How did you actively contribute to the Turing community?

I participated by going to Hack the Dot (a hackathon in the Turing basement), pairing (once for 4 hours), duing my cleaning duty, by making coffee whenver it's empty, and by bringing an uplifting attitude to the Turing community on a daily basis.  I would say my biggest contribution is that passion and energy I bring to everything (okay 80%) of what I do.

# Portfolio Rubric

For Module 2, your portfolio will be evaluated using the following rubric. Earning at least
a three in each category is the baseline for promotion/graduation.

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations. If you were exempt from the assessment it's a *3*.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4"s on the assessment (Module 3 requires three or more "4"s)
* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment || excused from assessment
* 2: Student earned one score below "3" on the assessment
* 1: Student earned two or more scores below "3" on the assessment

## B: Individual & Group Work

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, delivers a high-quality product, and works to maximize their skill growth.

* 4: Student consistently helps their teammates be their best selves, learn at
an accelerated pace, and achieve great results and demonstrates excellent growth by pushing their learning beyond expectations.
* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results or a clearly upward-sloping trend.
* 2: Student participates somewhat in their group work but is either not a
dependable member of the team or achieves consistently sub-par work and may demonstrate some lack of engagement or growth in their individual skill.
* 1: Student is not a valuable member of their teams and does not show the commitment expected of Turing students.

## C: Professional Skills

A Turing student values professional growth and seeks opportunities to continuously improve.

* 4: Student demonstrates dedication to their professional growth by not only completing the expected deliverable(s) but also pursuing additional opportunities for professional development beyond what is presented in sessions.
* 3: Student demonstrates satisfactory dedication, understanding, and growth of professional development through their deliverables from PD sessions.
* 2: Student demonstrates some lack of understanding or growth of professional development through their deliverables from PD sessions.
* 1: Student puts minimal effort into deliverable(s), does not follow directions, or is off topic.
* 0: Student does not complete the deliverable(s).

## D: Feedback
